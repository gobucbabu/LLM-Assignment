Fine-Tuning DistilBERT for Masked Language Modeling
This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained DistilBERT model for masked language modeling (MLM). DistilBERT is a smaller, faster version of BERT, designed to retain most of BERT’s performance while being more efficient.

Steps Involved:
Dataset Preparation: Mask certain tokens in the input text randomly.
Data Collation: Use a special data collator to handle the masking process during training.
Training: Utilize the Hugging Face Trainer API to manage the training loop, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler.
Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance in predicting masked tokens accurately.
